<!-- excerpt start -->
This year we hosted three Nuffield students for a two week research placement.
<!-- excerpt end -->

Angela and Anna hosted three young people through the Nuffield placements to learn and experience science first hand. In this project, the students learned about and performed PCRs, Golden Gate ligations, _E. coli_ transformations, plasmid extractions, and restriction enzyme digests. They were also supported while writing a report describing their experiments and a poster to be shared with their peers.

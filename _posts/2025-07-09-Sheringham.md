<!-- excerpt start -->
A whole group day trip to Sheringham to welcome Dasha.
<!-- excerpt end -->
The Nieduszynski Group donned their deerstalkers and became detectives in an interactive whodunnit that took
us across various landmarks and historical sites in Sheringham. Following the fun clues we discovered who the
murderer was just in time for lunch! After a scrumptious meal and some drinks in the The Lobster pub we
attempted a team-building spaghetti fortress exercise (which may or may not have ended in disaster) and some
Spanish card games to keep us entertained on the train home.

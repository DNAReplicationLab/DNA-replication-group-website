<!-- excerpt start -->
For the first time we've run a course on detection of DNA base modification using nanopore sequencing.
<!-- excerpt end -->
We had an intense, but hugely enjoyable two days. Thank you to all the participants for your enthusiasm, hard work and positive feedback.
We already have a lot of interest in running the course again - if you're interested follow the [link](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/events/detection-dna-base-modification-using-nanopore-sequencing) to join the waiting list.

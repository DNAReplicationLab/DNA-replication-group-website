The latest multi-omics approaches to study biological systems.
<!-- excerpt end -->
I went to the inaugural Functional Multi-Omics Conference hosted by the new Centre of Microbial Interactions (CMI) here on the Norwich Research Park. CMI’s aim is to bring together all those individuals who work on microbes on the park to improve collaboration, communication and innovation. The day revolved around genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics, with a focus on how to integrate data across the different approaches. They hosed keynote speaker Professor Lars Barquist, open panel discussion around the integration of functional multi-omics data and several flash talks and posters. I found the conference enjoyable – they even had interactive group sessions! One of which used multi-omics approaches to figure out which pathway was producing a metabolite of interest. As someone who isn’t much involved in multi-omic approaches I felt like I learned a lot including how powerful multi-omic approaches can be for scientific discovery and potentially how it could align to my own work or future horizons as a PhD student.

<!-- excerpt start -->
Our first group day out on *Goose* as we welcome Lukasz on his first visit to Norwich.
<!-- excerpt end -->
Down the river Yare with coffee and croissant to *The Reedcuter* for lunch and back again. Lots of wonderful views and a chance to get to know Lukasz before he joins us as a PhD student in October. Big thanks to Isabel for organising.

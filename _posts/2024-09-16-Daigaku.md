Prof. Yasukazu Daigaku \(Cancer Institute of the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo\) visited and gave a seminar, "*The balance of accuracy and efficiency in DNA polymerases during genome replication*". We enjoyed lots of fun opportunities to talk science, have some drinks and explore Norfolk together.

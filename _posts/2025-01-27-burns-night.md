<!-- excerpt start -->
A traditional Burns supper followed by games at Angela's.
<!-- excerpt end -->
A Caledonian night fuelled by haggis, nepes and tatties for main, cranachan, shortbread for sweet and washed down with a beverage, not excluding a dram or two of whiskey.
Sustenance was needed for the games including poo-curling, Toss the Wombat and a Scottish “Who Am I?”.
There was a very authentic “Address to the Haggis” by Sian before it was slain! And finally, we were also graced by the presence of Chilean \(Scots\)man in a kilt \(Eduardo\).

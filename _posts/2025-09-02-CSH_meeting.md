<!-- excerpt start -->
Angela, Anna, Conrad and Nerea attend and present at the CSH DNA replication meeting
<!-- excerpt end -->

Another fantastic iteration of the CSHL Eukaryotic DNA replication and genome maintenance meeting. There were many facinating advances presented and a lot of interest in our work. We presented:\
*Unbiased detection of replication initiation events in human cells
using BrdU incorporation and single-molecule nanopore
sequencing* - Angela.\
*Single-molecule nanopore sequencing maps replication
dynamics across the fission yeast genome, including
centromeres* Isabel's work, but presented by Conrad.\
*Single-molecule landscape of DNA replication pausing* presented by Anna as part of collaboration with Sathish.
and *In vivo DNA replication dynamics genome-wide at single-
molecule resolution* presented by Nerea as part of our collaboration with Bénédicte Desvoyes and Crisanto Gutiérrez.

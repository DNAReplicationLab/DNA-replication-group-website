Discovering where DNA replication initiates in human cells is crucial for understanding how cells copy their genetic information. Our study explores where and how often DNA replication begins across the human genome. To achieve this, we employed a technique using *in vivo* BrdU incorporation followed by detection by single-molecule nanopore sequencing. We discovered that a large proportion of DNA replication begins outside known initiation zones, demonstrating a dispersed initiation pattern across the genome.

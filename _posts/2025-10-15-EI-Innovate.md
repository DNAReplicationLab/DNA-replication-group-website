I attended and presented a poster at the annual EI Innovate Conference in October 2025. The day aims to foster collaboration, share success stories with the latest technologies and advancements and build networks to enable partnerships in future. The day started off with talks from PhD students (chaired by Conrad) whose projects are shared with an industry partner, detailing the benefits of a PhD in collaboration and how it developed their early career. There were also many talk from fantastic researchers including Dr. Philip Zegerman from Tropic Bioscience and their new product the anti-browning banana, and Professor Tom Ellis \(Imperial\) with his synthetic genome modules work. After the lunch I presented my poster detailing my project *The Causes and Consequences of Short Tandem Repeats on the Human Genome* and how the use of ONT Nanopore Flow Cells is enabling my research. I enjoyed explaining the science and the challenge of communicating it to a varied audience â€“ some of whom were based in business/law and had no scientific background. Overall the day the was very interesting and something I would recommend others to participate in if offered the chance.

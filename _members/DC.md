My current research focuses on developing an effective method for delivering synthetic chromosomes from yeast into plant cells. I will also lead work on ensuring the stability and maintenance of these synthetic chromosomes once inside the plant. 

Before joining Conrad Nieduszynski group, I completed my PhD in Nicola Patronâ€™s lab at Earlham Institute, where I investigated the biosynthetic pathways of plant metabolites with therapeutic potential using synthetic biology approaches. Prior to this, I completed my MSc in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh.

I use computational modeling to solve biological problems. My current focus is on studying problems associated with DNA synthesis in the Nieduszynski group at the Earlham Institute. Using nanopore sequencing, I try to identify hotspots of genome instability.

Before I came to the Earlham Institute, I worked on the mechanisms involved in cell division and in neurotransmission at Columbia University in New York, where I received my Ph.D. and completed a postdoctoral stint.

When I'm not in the office, I love staying active. I enjoy cycling, both for the exercise and the opportunity to explore new areas. I'm also an avid chess player. In addition, I have a passion for coding and for using my skills to build new tools.

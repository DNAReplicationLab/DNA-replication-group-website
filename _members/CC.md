My project involves using nanopore sequencing to analyse the relationship between replication dynamics and short tandem repeats in cultured human cell lines. I also use computational methods for statistical analysis and visualisation.

Before working at the Earlham Institute I completed a BSc Hons from the University of Warwick and worked in industries focusing on synthetic biology.

Outside of Earlham I engage in a variety of artistic hobbies like painting, sewing and crocheting.

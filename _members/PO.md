Phoebe developed an interest in genomics during a research year in the laboratory of Professor Rup Lal 
at the University of Delhi, India, during which she studied the microbial diversity of chemical dumpsites. 
She moved from there to Cambridge University to pursue a Masters in Computational Biology. She completed her 
masterâ€™s thesis with Dr Mikhail Spivakov, using single cell and population-based RNASeq of vascular smooth 
muscle cells to investigate the cellular etiology of atherosclerosis.  
Phoebe continued using sequencing approaches to study the impact of genome spatial organisation on the 
regulation of DNA replication timing in mammalian cells, and polymerase usage in yeast.

Steph studied Cell and Molecular Biology at Oxford Brookes University. 
Following on from her work on *H. influenzae* during her degree, her early career focused on 
menigococcal interactions with host cells with Dr Mumtaz Virji at the University of Oxford. 
From there she moved to industry working on the VIVOST® fibrin sealant project at Oxford Bioresearch 
and then moved to the Oxford University spin out company Prolysis, lead by Professor Jeff Errington, 
where she continued her work with <em>H. influenzae</em> and early stage antibacterial development. 
Steph worked in the Nieduszynski lab as a lab manager ensuring the smooth running of the group and was a member of the Athena Swan committee.
Outside the lab she enjoys face painting and films.

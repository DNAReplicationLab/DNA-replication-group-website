Carolin was an undergraduate student at the University of Ulm, Germany. In 2008, she moved to the UK to take up a BBSRC-funded PhD Fellowship at the University of Nottingham as the Nieduszynski group's first graduate student. Carolin developed and used novel state-of-the-art molecular technologies, mathematical modeling and computational programming to address fundamental biological questions about molecular inheritance. In 2013 and 2016, Carolin was awarded BBSRC-funded research grants as a co-investigator to continue her research in the Nieduszynski group at a post-doctoral level, first at the University of Nottingham and from 2014 at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford. In 2017, Carolin was elected the Extraordinary Junior Research Fellow in Physiology at the Queen's College, Oxford.
During her PhD studies, Carolin's primary research interests became directed toward understanding how biological information is passed from one generation to the next without error – the basis for all life on earth. Her  work included the discovery that the time at which a gene replicates during S-phase can influence the gene's expression level. Carolin established a DNA sequencing-based method to detect replication fork movement on extremely long, single molecules - that we named DNAscent.

Isabel completed her PhD at the John Innes Centre under the supervision of Tony Maxwell, focusing on the mechanisms of action of quinolone antibiotics. She subsequently worked with the Knowledge Exchange and Commercialisation team at the John Innes Centre, assisting technology platforms with external clients. Following this, she joined the DNA Replication Group as a postdoctoral researcher.

Isabel investigates the dynamics of replication in fission yeast, with a particular interest in the role of the helicase senataxin in resolving transcription-replication conflicts. Outside the lab, she enjoys cooking, creating memes, and advocating for Parkrun.

Emma studied Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry at the University of Oxford. She carried out her final 
year research project in Conradâ€™s lab, investigating regulators of DNA replication origin activity. For her 
PhD, she continued to explore the regulation of DNA replication origin activity, as well as working 
on developing a method to study DNA replication on single molecules.

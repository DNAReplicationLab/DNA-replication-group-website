Dima did his diploma studies at the Belarusian State University where his extracurricular laboratory work focused on increasing 
phenylalanine production by *Brevibacterium flavum* (now calledÂ *Corynebacterium glutamicum*) in the laboratory of
[Prof Natalia Maximova](http://www.bio.bsu.by/genetics/maximovanp_english.phtml).
His diploma project was carried out at the University of Edinburgh in the laboratory of [Dr Eric Schirmer]
(http://www.wcb.ed.ac.uk/research/schirmer) where Dima worked on Sun2 phosphorylation. After receiving a [Darwin Trust of Edinburgh]
(http://www.bshs.org.uk/the-darwin-trust-of-edinburgh-postgraduate-research-scholarship-in-the-history-or-philosophy-of-science-and-technology)
scholarship, Dima continued working on transmembrane nuclear envelope proteins during his PhD studies in the same laboratory. 
Dima discovered the role of several novel nuclear envelope proteins in adipogenesis and chromosome repositioning.
During his last years in Edinburgh, Dima's interest in whole-genome sequencing grew and led to him realise that the technique 
can be used to study DNA replication. Using cutting-edge approaches to answer fundamental biological questions is the hallmark 
of the Nieduszynski laboratory and this convinced Dima to change his research focus to DNA replication. Following this tradition, 
Dima applied a novel, high-throughput digital PCR approach to study locus-specific DNA replication timing. His passion for standardising 
and simplifying research has led him to develop several analysis tools that are easy to use thanks to web-based GUIs.

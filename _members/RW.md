Rose’s interest in the control of DNA replication began during her B.Sc. in Biochemistry (Year In Industry) at the University of Leeds. 
Rose spent her industrial placement in the Target Validation Department at GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, and her final year project
in [Dr Ian Wood’s lab](https://biologicalsciences.leeds.ac.uk/school-biomedical-sciences/staff/158/dr-ian-wood\), investigating 
the transcriptional regulator REST in breast cancer. For her PhD she moved to 
[Prof Dawn Coverley’s](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/biochemistry-biophysics/dawn-coverley/) lab at the University of York, 
working on the temporal and spatial organisation of DNA replication, particularly in relation to the nuclear matrix, and the DNA 
replication protein CIZ1.  
Moving to the University of Oxford, Rose completed a postdoc with [Prof Catherine Green](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/green)
investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying a recently discovered DNA repair disorder, caused by a mutation in the DNA 
replication factor PCNA. In 2017, Rose joined the Nieduszynski lab applying existing skills to studying the control of DNA 
replication timing and learning new skills using whole genome sequencing technologies.

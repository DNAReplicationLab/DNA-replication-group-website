Angela obtained her PhD in 1996 from the University of Bristol in Plant Molecular Biology, a project looking at characterising and manipulating a homologue of the yeast sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1) gene in Solanum tuberosum. Following a 2-year career break, she returned to research and over the years has worked with a variety of systems from human eyes, Tsetse flies and trypanosomes, Salmonella, cell lines and mouse models. A common focus being the immunological and molecular biological aspects in projects in a variety of research areas - from food allergy to immune cell bacterial clearance in the gut to autophagy. Angela joined the Earlham Institute in 2017 and has used her wet lab skills to complete a variety of genomics-based projects. She joined the Nieduszynski group in 2023 to work on the Cellular Genomics Institute Strategic Programme (CELLGEN ISP) which looks to study the consequences of somatic genomic variation on traits in healthy model systems.
